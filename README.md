Goal
To practice creating page layouts using Bootstrap and Sass.

Level 1 Process
You can use the CDN version of Bootstrap or customise the library using the source Bootstrap Sass files.

Level 2 Process 
Use BEM to name your custom classes. Add them to the elements in addition to Bootstrapâ€™s classes since Bootstrap does not follow BEM.
